        description:"While studying at Bitmaker, we had the challenge of breaking into groups of 4, and building something with a 2 week deadline. My group chose to create a fun app which helps you to visualize your wardrobe and pack for a holiday. It includes an outfit checker which allows you to mix and match clothing items, as well as a drag and drop feature created with JQuery UI where the user can drag items and save them into their suitcase. We also integrated a weather API to show the weather of your destination, to add to the virtual packing experience.",

Financial Advice for All, a coalition website to protect access to financial advice for Canadians, is one example.
