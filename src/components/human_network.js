          <h1>The Human Network</h1>
          <p>I took on a front-end freelance project for a Start-Up company directly upon graduating Bitmaker to improve my speed and skill with CSS and Javascript. Working with one other team member, we created a mock website for a political social networking website. We met with the client, assisted with creative direction and built a product that could be used to pitch the idea to investors for further funding.</p>
